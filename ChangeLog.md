# Change Log

# 2021-05-01
Issue Generated files are set as executable #15 fixed

# 2021-04-26 v3.2.3
Module path supports major version v3

# 2021-02-27 v3.2.2
Bug in lexer state machine generation fixed by Paul Samways

# 2021-01-05 v3.2.1
Escaped characters are now correctly handled in `string_lit`. 
Please see the [grammar](gogll.md) for constraints enforced by gogll on the use
of certain escaped characters `string_lit` as `SyntaxSymbol`.

This version does not support Rust.

# 2020-08-12 v3.2.0
Suppressed tokens added to lexer. See [gogll.md](gogll.md)

# 2020-08-11 v3.1.8
Bug fixed in handling of empty productions.

# 2020-06-28 v3.1.6
This version of gogll supports generation of Rust and Go LR(1) parsers as
well as GLL. Pager's Practical General Method and Knuth's original machine are
both supported.

# v3.1.1
1. Unnecessary match statements removed from generated Rust lexer code.
1. Generated Rust lexer markdown loading performance improved.

# 2020-05-19 v3.1.0
Rust target added.

# 2020-05-13 v3.0.9
1. Global variables removed from parser and BSR.

# 2020-05-01
1. tokens have a method: GetLineColumn()

# 2020-04-30
1. Bugfix in lexer closure algorithm.

# 2020-04-29
1. Some semantic checks implemented
	1. Check that referenced NTs and TokIDs are declared.
1. Gogll stops with an error if the parse forest is ambiguous

# 2020-04-25
1. GoGLL v3.0.3 has both a lexer and parser generated by GoGLL v3.0.2. This version compiles itself.

# 2020-04-??
1. GoGLL v3.0.2 has a GoGLL parser generated by GoGLL v3.0.1 and a hand-written lexer. This is the final bootstrap version.
1. v3.0.2 generates a GoGLL parser with a matching linear-time FSA lexer from one input grammar.

# 2020-04-22
1. GOGLL v3.0.1 features a GoGLL parser generated by GoGLL v3.0.0 and a hand-written
FSA lexer. It is used to bootstrap the GoGLL v3.0.2 which generates both a linear-time FSA 
lexer for a matching GLL parser.

# 2020-04-17 
1. GoGLL v3.0.0 (worktree gogll-lex). This is the basic bootstrap version of GoGLL v3. 
This version is made with Gocc and generates syntax-only GoGLL v3.0.1 parser.

# 2019-09-13
1. Documentation added on how to walk the parse forest. [See](doc/bsr/bsr.md)

## 2019-09-10
1. testSelect is generated as a slice of functions, not a map of functions.
1. follow is generated as separate functions, not a map of functions.

## 2019-09-10 v2.0.0
1. Bug fixed in `ast.NewAnyOf` and `ast.NewNot`
1. Grammar change: `emptyAlt` replace by `empty`. `emptyAlt` was a vestige of 
the bootstrap gocc compiler.

## 2019-09-09
BSR performance improved.
